### JavaScript Notes

While HTML and CSS determine the structure and style of a page, JavaScript owns the behavior. It allows a designer to access the functionality inherent in an object oriented language.

Conditional statements are formatted like so:

```
if (*this is true*) {
    then do this;
} else if (*this is true*) {
    then do this;
} else {
    do this;
}
```

Commenting syntax:

`// this is a single line comment`

```
/* this is a
    multi-line comment */
```

Variables have to be declared in JavaScript before they are assigned:

```
var variableName;
variableName = Value;
```

or

`var variableName = Value`;

When escaping characters in a string, use a backslash.

The boolean values are all lowercase:

```
true
false
```

### Notes on HTML

###### Process and Design

A main component of site design is considering who the target users are and how they would want or need to interact with the page. A handy way to do this is to create a few fictional users and consider them throughout the design process. Ask yourself what their motivations and goals are for using the site. This informs where you should put information and services to cater to the user's goals.

Time to start forming an outline. Begin by creating a site map, like a flowchart representing the paths a user could follow from the home page. Then create wireframes for the pages that will allow users to follow their mapped courses. And consider the effect that grouping content will have. Create a visual heirarchy to lead the user's focus to priority content through size, color, and style choices.

## CSS Images

Positioning images can be tricky, especially with them being inline elements. Floating them left or right can make them look cleaner amongst text. But to get more rigid control, just changing the `display` property to `block` is effective.

`background-image: url("hyperlink here");` allows use of an image as a background. Unless the image is the exact size of its background area, then it may need to repeat to cover the whole of what is intended. `background-repeat: repeat;` will allow it to repeat in all directions, but specifying `repeat-x` or `repeat-y` will limit it horizontally and vertically.

## Practical Information

A focus for designing a webpage that is looking to attract visitors is SEO (Search Enging Optimization). Part of that process is getting other pages to link to yours. And the other part is getting especially the text on your page to match the keywords that interested users would search.

All text fields in the HTML are useful. So pay attention to the title, address, headers, and alt-text fields. To find the right words, there's nothing better than researching what language target users would naturally choose to find your site. And searching yourself to see what other sites might come up and what words they use.

Goggle Analytics is a free service that allows you to get metrics on your page. It can help identify what types of users are see it and where they're coming from. That can help you identify what is working and what is not.

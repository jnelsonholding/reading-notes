## Perfect Teams

Google's data suggests empathy makes for more effective teamwork. It's interesting to approach an issue from that direction. I'm glad that conclusion is what the research pointed to. Can you imagine if Google did a 4 year dedicated research project on team dynamics and then published results indicating that people shouldn't be considerate of one another because it reduces productivity?

Seriously though, they found a strong correlation between the amount of social sensitivity team members had with their ability to be successful as a group. While this should probably not be a revolutionary finding, it is often not the standard in workplaces. The idea of a lone super contributor can be attractive to employers. However, solid teamwork has become more necessary with the variety of tasks that are required to complete projects.

Be kind to each other.

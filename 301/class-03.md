## Mustache

Mustache is a template syntax, or specification, that works for creating template HTML views. With mustache.js you can create a standard template use Javascript to give it data from a JSON source.

The basic concept of a template is that combining it with input data (like JSON) and running it through a template engine with create an output. So in some senses it's like another way to build quick and efficient functions with less logic required.

## Flexbox

Flexbox is a useful module of CSS that makes responsive web design much easier. It's best applied to components or small scale layouts. Grids are better for large scale.

To apply it to a page, first target a parent or container and give it the property `display: flex;`. From there you can also specify general details of how the contents of the parent will float, such as direction, wrapping, alignment, and spacing.

Then target the children with properties specific to each of them. You can define the order that individual elements should appear in. Also individual elements can be told to shrink or grow and if they should align uniquely.

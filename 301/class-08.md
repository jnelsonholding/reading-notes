### Class 08 Reading Notes

## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's the language used for SQL style relational database operations. Databases operate in the CRUD model: create, read, update, and DESTROY. In SQL, those corresponding commands are CREATE, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

SQL allows for retrieving data within parameters from database tables and relating them to each other. This can create advantages for avoiding repetetive storage. For instance if there's a massive table of cars and their colors are listed, then the colors column would be filled with strings of things like "red", "silver", and "sunflower yellow". Instead of writing those strings into the car table repeatedly, they can be stored in a separate table called colors and each color can have a unique ID. Then the car table can just reference those IDs instead of being filled with strings.

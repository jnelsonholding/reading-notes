### Class 13 Reading Notes

## Form Data

Form Data is sent on two methods, GET or POST. GET requests include information in the actual URL address, so they are easily accessible but also visible to anyone. POST requests keep the information secure.

The form element in HTML has a `method` attribute that allows for either of these methods. The other attribute that needs to be defined to use the form is `action`. Action determines the end point of the information, or the targeted route. It can either be an absolute URL, a relative path (best for passing around a local server), or nothing (sends the information to the current route).

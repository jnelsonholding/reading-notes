### Notes on choosing a text editor

[Choosing a text editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) breaks down the process of finding the right tool for you. Interesting to note that operating systems come with basic text editors. But they will likely not include some helpful functionality like syntax highlighting and auto-complete.

The more useful editors have to be sought out. But depending on what you need, they have a much wider feature set. Using an editor that has extensions available means you'll be able to customize it to your needs. And in the end, what really matters is that you're happy using it. So a little research and some experimentation should get a developer to the right tool for them.

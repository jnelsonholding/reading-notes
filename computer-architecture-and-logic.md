### How do computers actually work?

There are 4 operations common to all computers:

- taking input
- storing information
- processing information
- outputing results

The input can take many forms. Using a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or really any sensor that can trigger an electrical signal. But regardless of the type of input, it's all stored the same way.

A simple way of looking at storage is a series of wires or electrical paths that are either turned on or off, representing 1 or 0 in binary. Everything input into the computer is translated into binary so it can be easily stored and processed.

The output can also take many forms. One of the most obvious are the visual display of a computer monitor. But output also takes the form of printers, sound from speakers, and some less tangible forms like direction of movement.

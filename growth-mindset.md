### Growth Mindset

To start, growth mindset is an attitude that everything can be learned. It's especially applicable to coding because there are so many tools and options available and it can be daunting. This is what I try to keep in mind to stay in that mindset:
  - Confusion is a natural part of learning. It's just the first step.
  - There are always other people who have stepped through the same challenges. It's ok to look for help.
  - **It's worth it.** The reward of solving a problem is even better when it was difficult to get through.

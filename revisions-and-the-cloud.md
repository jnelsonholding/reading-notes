### Notes on Git

Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) that allows users to take snapshots of their code and save them to the cloud. It's quick because it relies on local operations, while also providing change tracking and mitigating loss of data.

Handy commands:

command | description
:---: | ---
git help *(command)* | looks up help for a specific command
git clone *(repository link)* | clones an existing repository as a sub-directory to pwd
